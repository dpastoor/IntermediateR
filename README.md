2 day workshop material for "intermediate" R training with examples focusing on use for pharmaceutical sciences


Please feel free to contribute.

This is an amalgamation of material from around the web and books that have made understanding and using R easier. 

One of the biggest issues in diving into R is examples not targeted towards specific demographics - in my case, pharmaceutical sciences.

My goal is to rectify that by providing more relevant examples to the material at hand.
